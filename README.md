# Portfolio_frontened_prj
"I have built a frontend-based portfolio from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a navigation bar, hero section, about me section, and contact form, all designed for a clean and professional look.

I used CSS for styling, with Flexbox and Grid to ensure a modern, responsive layout that works on all devices. JavaScript adds interactivity, including smooth scrolling, a typewriter effect.

The site is fully responsive with media queries and has cool animations using CSS transitions and JavaScript libraries.
